# DAY 12

## Introduction
Twelfth lab on AWS

## Prerequisite
Connect to the AWS console, with administrator user

## Use Case
This lab walks you through the steps to create an S3 pre-sign URL. Here you will be creating an S3 bucket,
uploading objects, and using CloudShell you will create a short-lived URL i.e. pre sign URL.

## Cloud Research
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/tutorial-presigned-url.html

## Try yourself
### Steps
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Create an S3 bucket
3. Upload a file to an S3 Bucket
4. Change an Environment in CloudShell
5. Run the S3 pre-sign command and test the output

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome
* You have successfully created a new AWS S3 Bucket
* You have successfully uploaded an image to the S3 bucket
* You have learned to create a CloudShell environment
* You have learned how to create an S3 pre sign URL
