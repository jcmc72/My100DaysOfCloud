# DAY 9

## Introduction
Nineth lab on AWS

## Prerequisite
Connect to the AWS console, with administrator user

## Use Case
Labs through the steps to Enable Cross-Region Replication and versioning in Amazon S3

## Cloud Research
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-example-walkthroughs.html

## Try yourself
### Steps

1. Login to AWS Management Console.
2. Create a S3 Source Bucket.
3. Enable Versioning for source bucket.
4. Enable Cross Region Replication and add rule for source bucket.
5. Create a S3 Target Bucket.
6. Enable Versioning for target bucket.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome
* You have successfully created the S3 Source Bucket
* You have successfully created the S3 Target Bucket
* You have successfully Tested Cross-Region Replication Configuration
