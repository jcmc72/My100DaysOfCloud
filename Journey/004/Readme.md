# DAY 4

## Introduction
Fourth lab on AWS

## Prerequisite
Allocating Elastic IP and Associating it to EC2 Instance

## Use Case
To use an Elastic IP address, you need to allocate one to your account and then You allocate an Elastic IP address and associated it with the running instance or a network interface

## Cloud Research
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/intro-elastic-ip-addresses/

## Try yourself
### Steps
1. Open the onsole
2. Service EC2, create an Amazon Linux Instance from an Amazon Linux AMI
3. SSH into your instance and configure your server as a web server
5. Create and publish a sample test.html file
6. Test the page with the public IP address of EC2 Instance created
7. Allocate an Elastic IP and associate it to the EC2 Instance
8. Test the page with Elastic IP address of EC2 Instance

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome
Launch and configure a EC2 Instance and allocate an Elastic IP
	
1. Web server with public IP
