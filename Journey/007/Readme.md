# DAY 7

## Introduction
Sixth lab on AWS

## Prerequisite
Connect to the AWS console, with administrator user

## Use Case
AWS S3 creates a sample S3 bucket, uploading an object to the S3 bucket and setting up the bucket permission and policy

## Cloud Research
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html

## Try yourself
### Steps
1. Log into the AWS Management Console
2. Create an S3 bucket
3. Enable object versioning on the bucket
4. Upload a text file to the S3 Bucket
5. Test object versioning by changing the text file and re-uploading it

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome
* You have successfully created an S3 Bucket
* You have successfully enabled Object Versioning on the Bucket
* You have successfully uploaded a test file into the Bucket and tested its versioning

Enable object versioning on the bucket
