# DAY 5

## Introduction
Fifth lab on AWS

## Prerequisite
Connect to the AWS console, with administrator user.

## Use Case
AWS S3 creates a sample S3 bucket, uploading an object to the S3 bucket and setting up the bucket permission and policy.

## Cloud Research
https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc=sn&loc=1

## Try yourself
### Steps
1. Open the onsole.
2. Service S3 creates a Bucket.
3. Upload a example image.
4. Verify the access permisions in the browser, we dont have permission to access the object in the bucket.
5. Edit the permissions to Everyone (public access).
6. Test the access to the bucket in the browser accessing by ARN bucket, the access to the object is enable.
7. Edit the bucket policy into the Bucket policy editor.
8. Upload a new example image, verify the access permisions. 
9. Verify the access permisions in the browser, we have permission to access the object in the bucket.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome
AWS S3 upload object and configure public access 
* Successfully created a new AWS S3 Bucket.
* Successfully uploaded an image to the S3 bucket.
* Successfully change S3 object permissions.
* Successfully create an S3 bucket policy.
